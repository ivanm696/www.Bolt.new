X Builder
CI

AI-powered full-stack web development in the browser.

Based on Bolt.new - the open-source AI web development agent by StackBlitz.

Production
🚀 Live URL: https://x-builder-staging.pages.dev

Status: Production (Cloudflare Pages)

Note: Custom domain can be added later without downtime.

About
X Builder is a white-label fork of Bolt.new that allows you to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser.

Features
Full-Stack in the Browser: Integrates AI models with an in-browser development environment powered by StackBlitz's WebContainers

Install and run npm tools and libraries (Vite, Next.js, etc.)
Run Node.js servers
Interact with third-party APIs
Deploy to production from chat
AI with Environment Control: AI models have complete control over the filesystem, node server, package manager, terminal, and browser console

Tips and Tricks
Be specific about your stack: Mention frameworks/libraries in your initial prompt
Use the enhance prompt icon: Refine your prompt with AI assistance before submitting
Scaffold basics first: Establish the foundation before adding advanced features
Batch simple instructions: Combine multiple simple tasks in one message
Technical Notes
MVP Publish (Cloudflare Pages)
X Builder includes an MVP publish feature that deploys projects directly to Cloudflare Pages.

Components:

app/lib/stores/publish.ts - State management for publish status
app/routes/api.publish.ts - API endpoint for Cloudflare Pages deployment
app/components/workbench/PublishButton.client.tsx - UI button component
Environment Variables (for publish to work at runtime):

CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN - API token with Pages permissions
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID - Your Cloudflare account ID
TODO: The Cloudflare Pages Direct Upload API implementation may need adjustment based on actual API requirements for production use.

Cross-Origin Isolation
X Builder requires crossOriginIsolated to be enabled for WebContainers (SharedArrayBuffer). This is achieved via HTTP headers:

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
These headers are set in:

public/_headers - Cloudflare Pages static headers
app/entry.server.tsx - Server-side rendering
functions/[[path]].ts - Cloudflare Pages Functions
vite.config.ts - Development server
To verify: Open DevTools console and check self.crossOriginIsolated === true

Development
Prerequisites
Node.js 20.15.1+
pnpm 9.4.0+
Setup
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
Scripts
pnpm run dev - Start development server
pnpm run build - Build for production
pnpm run lint - Run ESLint
pnpm run typecheck - Run TypeScript checks
pnpm test - Run tests
Deployment
Production deploys automatically from main branch via GitHub Actions to Cloudflare Pages.

Required GitHub Secrets:

CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN - Cloudflare API token with Pages edit permissions
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID - Your Cloudflare account ID
Release Process
1. Create a Pull Request with your changes
2. CI runs automatically (lint, typecheck, tests)
3. CI must pass before merge is allowed
4. Merge PR to main
5. Auto-deploy to production (Cloudflare Pages)
Safeguards:

Branch protection requires PR reviews
All CI checks must pass
Direct pushes to main are blocked
Linear history enforced
